MongoDB Steps:

Download the latest 64-bit MSI version of windows.
Run the installer (.msi file)
Add it to your PATH of environment variables. it Should be from:
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.0\bin
now Create a “\data\db” folder in C:/ which is used by mongodb to store all data. You should have this folder:

C:\data\db

Note: This is the default directory location expected by mongoDB, don’t create anywhere else
.

Finally, open command prompt and type:

>> mongod
You should see it asking for permissions (allow it) and then listen to a port. After that is done, open another command prompt, leaving the previous one running the server.

Type in the new command prompt

>> mongo
You should see it display the version and connect to a test database.

This proves successful install!=)
